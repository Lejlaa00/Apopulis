HOW TO ADD HTTP SERVER SUPPORT
================================

The HTTP server functionality is prepared but commented out in main.cpp.
To activate it, you need to download the cpp-httplib library.

STEP 1: Download httplib.h
---------------------------
Download the single header file from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/master/httplib.h

Or visit the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib

Save the file as "httplib.h" in this folder:
c:\Users\Korisnik\Desktop\folders\faculty\treca godina\projekat\Apopulis\blockchain\blockchain\

STEP 2: Uncomment HTTP Server Code
-----------------------------------
Open main.cpp and look for these commented sections:

1. At the top, uncomment:
   // #define CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT
   // #include "httplib.h"

2. At the bottom, uncomment the entire HTTP SERVER IMPLEMENTATION section:
   - startHttpServer() function
   - Command line argument parsing
   - HTTP endpoint handlers

STEP 3: Rebuild Project
------------------------
1. Build -> Clean Solution
2. Build -> Build Solution
3. If successful, the HTTP server will be available

STEP 4: Test Multi-Node Setup
------------------------------
Open two terminals:

Terminal 1:
   blockchain.exe --port 8080

Terminal 2:
   blockchain.exe --port 8081 --peer http://localhost:8080

When node 1 mines a block, it will send it to node 2.
When node 2 mines a block, it will send it to node 1.

HTTP ENDPOINTS:
---------------

GET /chain
   Returns the entire blockchain as JSON
   Example: curl http://localhost:8080/chain

POST /block
   Submit a new mined block
   Body: JSON block object
   Example: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @block.json http://localhost:8080/block

POST /chain
   Submit an entire chain (for synchronization)
   Body: JSON array of blocks
   Example: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @chain.json http://localhost:8080/chain

WHY NOT INCLUDED BY DEFAULT:
-----------------------------
httplib.h is a third-party library (~10,000 lines of code) that should
be downloaded directly from the official source to ensure you have the
latest version with all security updates.

ALTERNATIVE: TEST WITHOUT HTTP
-------------------------------
The current implementation works perfectly for testing all core
blockchain features without HTTP support. You can:
- Mine blocks
- Validate chains
- Test difficulty adjustment
- Verify all algorithms

HTTP is only needed for multi-node communication, which can be added later.
